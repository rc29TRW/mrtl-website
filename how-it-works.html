    <h1>How ASTRA Works</h1>

    <p>
      ASTRA is a modular, scriptable trading automation system that bridges TradingView alerts with automated execution through your brokerage or prop firm. It is designed to eliminate hesitation, automate high-probability setups, and allow you to focus on strategy — not execution.
    </p>

    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>TradingView</strong> – The front-end platform where your strategies and alerts are created.</li>
      <li><strong>Pine Script</strong> – Your custom strategy script generates buy/sell alerts using strict logic and indicators.</li>
      <li><strong>Webhook Server</strong> – Hosted on Replit or your own server. This receives alerts in real-time and executes trades.</li>
      <li><strong>Broker Integration</strong> – ASTRA connects directly with your prop firm or broker (Rithmic, Tradovate, etc.) to place orders on your behalf.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Automation Workflow</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>You configure your trading logic and indicators inside TradingView using Pine Script.</li>
      <li>ASTRA's Pine Script template allows alerts to fire based on highly specific entry conditions.</li>
      <li>When the conditions are met, a webhook alert is triggered and sent to the ASTRA server.</li>
      <li>The server processes the signal and executes the corresponding action (market order, limit order, stop-loss, take-profit, etc.) via your linked broker account.</li>
      <li>All trades are logged and tracked instantly for your review.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Why Use ASTRA?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No more missed entries:</strong> Trades are executed instantly based on conditions — no delay, no hesitation.</li>
      <li><strong>No emotional errors:</strong> ASTRA removes impulsive decisions and lets your rules do the work.</li>
      <li><strong>Built for speed:</strong> Ultra-low latency alert handling and streamlined execution logic.</li>
      <li><strong>Fully customizable:</strong> You can edit the Pine Script, server logic, and webhook actions.</li>
      <li><strong>Beginner-friendly:</strong> Setup can be done in under 15 minutes with zero coding required (if using default logic).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Hosting Options</h2>
    <p>
      ASTRA comes with two options:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Self-Hosted:</strong> Use our Replit project (fully preconfigured). Just paste your webhook, deploy, and you're done.</li>
      <li><strong>Done-For-You:</strong> Let us host your ASTRA automation for you. No maintenance or configuration needed. Just plug and trade.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Risk & Transparency</h2>
    <p>
      ASTRA is not a trading strategy. It is a tool. You are responsible for the logic you run and the platforms you trade on. That said, ASTRA is designed to minimize execution risk, improve consistency, and give you full visibility and control over your automation flow.
    </p>

    <h2>Example Use Case</h2>
    <p>
      You’ve built a strategy in TradingView that enters long when the 5EMA crosses above the 20EMA, RSI is above 50, and volume increases by 20%. You set this up in Pine Script, fire a webhook with your custom parameters, and ASTRA instantly places a market order with a fixed stop and trailing take-profit. The entire trade is managed hands-free — all you did was define the rules.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      ASTRA doesn’t guess. It doesn’t hesitate. It executes — instantly, and only when your logic says so.
      Whether you're scalping, swing trading, or building a portfolio of automated systems, ASTRA is the bridge between your strategy and execution.
