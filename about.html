    <h1>About ASTRA</h1>
    <p>
      ASTRA (Automated Strategic Trading & Risk Analysis) started as a deeply personal project built from countless hours of market study, algorithm research, and practical execution. Born from the frustration of emotional trading, inconsistent routines, and unreliable strategies, ASTRA was designed to be a smarter, faster, and more disciplined way to approach the futures market.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, what began as a simple tool evolved into a fully scriptable automation platform for traders of all levels. With a foundation in Pine Script and an emphasis on modular strategy logic, ASTRA allows traders to fully automate their edge — while retaining control. Whether you’re manually testing, running alerts to Discord, or executing trades live via webhooks, ASTRA gives you the framework to do it with precision.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our team consists of algorithmic traders, software engineers, and performance-driven creators. We believe in transparency, fast iteration, and results. Every feature, from trailing logic to swing detection, was designed for utility — not fluff. If it doesn’t improve performance or streamline your routine, it doesn’t belong in the bot.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ASTRA community is built around trust, innovation, and shared learning. We actively improve based on feedback, and we constantly test new ideas to stay ahead of evolving market conditions. Whether you’re new to automation or you’re scaling your edge across multiple markets, ASTRA helps you execute your strategy without hesitation or distraction.
    </p>

      We’re not just building a tool — we’re building a trading culture grounded in logic, discipline, and results. If you're serious about your trading, ASTRA is here to help you scale it.
