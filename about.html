    <h1>About ASTRA</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Our Origin</h2>
      <p>
        ASTRA began as a personal project, born from frustration with the inconsistency of manual trading. The founder — a trader who had spent years in the market — became determined to build a tool that removed emotion, hesitation, and overtrading from the process. What started as a few TradingView alerts linked to a webhook script grew into a powerful trading automation engine.

      <h2>What is ASTRA?</h2>
      <p>
        ASTRA (Automated Strategic Trading & Risk Analysis) is a modular trading system designed to streamline execution, reduce errors, and enable discipline in futures and crypto markets. Built on top of TradingView and modern scripting logic, it translates trading signals into real-time entries and exits through automation — either as a signal bot or a fully autonomous system.

      <h2>Why We Built It</h2>
      <p>
        Most traders struggle not because they lack skill, but because they lack consistency. Emotional decisions, late entries, overexposure — these flaws cost money. ASTRA was created to fix that. It’s not a magic money machine. It’s a performance tool. We wanted something that could:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Execute trades the instant alerts trigger</li>
        <li>Operate 24/7 with no manual input</li>
        <li>Manage risk based on logic, not feelings</li>
        <li>Adapt to different strategies — scalping, swing, or hybrid</li>
        <li>Integrate with multiple brokers and prop firm accounts</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Community Driven</h2>
      <p>
        After launching internally to a small group of traders, ASTRA quickly grew. Users offered feedback, suggested features, and helped refine the logic engine. From there, the bot evolved into a full suite: modular Pine Scripts, a webhook relay system, easy-to-use Replit hosting, and a custom interface for webhook parsing and signal routing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, ASTRA supports hundreds of users and continues to grow — powered by a community of traders, developers, and educators who believe in the value of automation.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        ASTRA isn’t about signals or secrets. It’s about structure. It’s about showing up with a plan — and having a system that sticks to it. Our mission is to give traders their time, clarity, and confidence back. Whether you want to run a signal service, automate a personal system, or test new strategies without risking emotional bias, ASTRA is here to empower you.
      </p>

      <h2>What’s Next</h2>
      <p>
        We’re actively developing new features based on user needs, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Native broker integrations (FTMO, Apex, Tradovate, Rithmic)</li>
        <li>Plug-and-play templates for beginner traders</li>
        <li>Expanded webhook logic with trailing stop management</li>
        <li>Advanced backtesting support & visual dashboards</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We believe ASTRA is just getting started.
      </p>
